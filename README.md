# Brickify LEGO Blog

Welcome to the Brickify LEGO blog, a dynamic web application designed for LEGO enthusiasts. This blog features advanced functionalities including pagination, a search filter, a carousel for latest posts, and user authentication for blog management.

## Features

- **Pagination**: Automatically paginates the main page to show no more than 12 posts at a time.
- **Carousel**: Displays the latest three posts with a prev/next button and navigation dots.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for blog posts based on titles.
- **Tag Filtering**: Users can filter posts by tags to easily find related content.
- **Single Post View**: Clicking on a post opens a detailed view (`/post/index.html`) that includes the title, image, text, author, publish date, and tags.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for blog management.
- **Post Management**: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete posts through `/post/edit.html` with required field validations and a character count feature.
